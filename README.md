## üéì Thesis and Final Project
**Doctoral Subject**: Motor Interference Models for Human-Robot Interaction  
This study examines 'motor interference,' which occurs when a person perceives a collaborator as humanlike and socially engaging, affecting their motor functions. This phenomenon is characterized by increased variability in hand movements, especially when another person is also making hand motions. Understanding and modeling motor interference can enhance human-robot collaborative tasks by integrating this knowledge into action-planning frameworks, thereby improving performance and safety.

**MSc Thesis Title**: Compliance Control of Collaborating Robots  
This thesis investigates the implementation and comparison of two compliance control schemes‚Äîhybrid position/force control and parallel position/force control‚Äîfor two collaborating industrial robots. It evaluates their performance in tracking force and motion within both static and dynamic environments facilitated by a second manipulator. Additionally, it examines the parallel control scheme's performance under varying mechanical impedances, providing insights into the optimal control scheme for specific conditions.

**BSc Final Group Project**: Stair Climbing Robot  
A team of three students designed a cost-effective robot capable of navigating stairs, utilizing durable materials, efficient design, and an Arduino board for motor control based on sensor input. The robot has potential applications in object transportation across varied elevations and in aiding the mobility of disabled individuals. The project received an A grade from the supervising professor.
